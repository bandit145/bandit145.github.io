I'm Philip Bove, an automation focused Linux Admin/Devops/SRE person.
My current position is a Consultant at <a href="https://www.redhat.com/en">Red Hat</a>

I enjoy working with Linux, Windows, Powershell, Python, and pretty much everything else related to I.T. because of this the blog will have wide ranging posts on many topics.
