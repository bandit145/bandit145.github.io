I'm Philip Bove, a CS student currently attending Southern Connecticut State University.
My current position is a Unix Administrator Student Worker at <a href="https://www.southernct.edu/">SCSU</a>

I enjoy working with Linux, Windows, Powershell, Python, and pretty much everything else related to I.T. because of this the blog will have wide ranging posts on many topics.
